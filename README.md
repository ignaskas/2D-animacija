//Start//

You wake up near a range of mountains that stretch across the horizon. Before you appears a glass key and three different chests. You realize that the key can open only one of these chests before falling apart. You have to choose:

A. A chest that is emitting a mystic light glow. You feel that something magic is inside.
B. The second chest looks sturdy, reinforced with metal casings. It looks like a soldier's footlocker.
C. The third chest looks from a technologically advanced era, all the machinery reinforcing it looks like from a sci-fi movie.

After opening the chest you find a glorious Wizard's Staff inside. You check out the newly found weapon adn find out that it can shoot powerful magic fireballs. The broken glass key leaves you wondering what interesting items the other two chests might have contained.

You open the sturdy chest and the key breaks, leaving you with an open chest that contains a Sharp Bastard Sword. You swing it slashing the air and the Sword feels perfectly balanced. You wonder what the other two chests could have provided.

You insert the glass key and hear some sort of buzz, the chest slowly opens before you and in a cloud of some sort of steam at the bottom of the chest you find a Plasma Blaster. The weapon seems pretty cool, but you wonder about the other two chests. However the broken glass key seems beyond repair.

//First Choice//

you decide that sitting near a mountain will not get you anywhere. Besides, you want to check out your newfound weapon, so you look around trying to decide which way  to go. Mountains behind you leave you with three choices:

A. a mysterious forest to the north.
B. a winding road to the east.
C. a meadow with a strange portal to the south.

You move towards the forest, it looks as if the trees move aside to make way for you to enter. As you step into the forest you har wind blowing through the leaves. The opening closes behind you.

The road east goes through fields, what adventures might await you there?

As you approach the portal, you feel being pulled towards it. 


//Forest//
As you walk through the forest, you see a small spring flowing between the trees. You feel really thirsty, and the water is really tempting. You choose:

A. you increase your pace, the forest is giving you the chills, you want to get away from it as soon as possible.
B. take a sip from the spring to quench your thirst.
C. fill your flask with the water and travel forward.

You move away from the spring, and a sigh of relief comes out of your mouth as you approach the end of the forest. You see a small village further away.

You take a sip of water, but it does only increase your thirst, you try drinking more, but you begin to feel weary. The moss near the spring looks really comforting. You doze off, and the last feeling you experience is water filling your lungs as your head is laying in the spring. You are dead.

As you move away from the spring you notice a dead deer near it. The deer looks like if has fallen asleep and drowned. Your choice has saved your life, and the enchanted water in your flask might come in handy in the future. You pass the forest without any further incidents and approach a small village.

//Path//
Following a path you approach a merchant in distress. The merchant cries for your help. It seems that some lizardmen have stolen his wares and run away. You have to decide:

A. Pursue the lizardmen to help the merchant reclaim the stolen treasure.
B. Ignore the merchant, you have more important matters to attend.
C. Chase and slay the lizardmen to take all the loot for yourself.

You follow the tracks left by the lizardmen and notice two of them trying to divide the items recently stolen from the merchant. As you approach, the lizardmen try to attack you, but you are faster, you draw your weapon, and the lizardmen flee in terror. You take the loot and return it back to the merchant. He is very pleased and rewards you with a hefty sum of coin. You follow the path further and approach a small village.

You ignore the cries of the merchant and move along. As you move along the road you approach a small town. 

You charge to the direction lizardmen were going to. You approach two lizardmen figures, draw the weapon and slay them where they stand before they can even make a move. The treasures they have stolen have no significant value, but you take them in hopes of pawning them. You return to the path and approach a small village.

//Town//

As you enter the town you notice a merchant sign. You enter the store to have a look.

        // if you came from the forest// You can ask for basic information about the place
        // if you helped the merchant// You can buy some armor and get some information
        // if you killed the goblins and took the loot// you are shamed by the townspeople and thrown out before being able to do anything
        // if you ignored the merchant// you can just see the armor and feel sorry you can't afford it
        
You leave the town and move onward with your journey. In the distance east you see a tower, northeast is a path leading towards a range of mountains.

A. A tower it is.
B. You choose a mountain path, maybe it will lead to dwarves.

//Mountains//
As you approach the mountains you notice a dwarf city. Dwarves are friendly and welcome you as one of their own. You show exceptional talent in building and drinking, and you like living with them. You decide to spend the rest of your life among the dwarves crafting things and drinking ale. You weren't the tallest person anyway. 

//Tower//
You notice a burning tower and a dragon moving around it as it spits giant fireballs. You have to act quick before the dragon sees you and you become his next charred crispy meal.:
A. You decide to take an attempt in defeating the dragon
B. You try to flee and avoid confronting the dragon
C. You try to sneak past the dragon and get away with some loot from the tower.

//Fight//
        //if you chose forest// you notice a half-eaten deer carcass and remember the effect of the water you poured into your flask had on a deer. Maybe it would work on a dragon too?
        you pour the water on the meat and hide nearby to wait for the dragon to return to feed. Soon enough the dragon returns to finish the meal. As soon as the meat is consumed, the dragon looks weakened. Time to strike! You pull out your weapon and charge the unsuspecting dragon. Your attack is successful and the dragon is defeated. A wizard comes ot of the tower and thanks you for saving his life. As a reward you receive a magic scroll, which reads:  NOULAIDOS KUPONO FOTO
        
        //if you have armour// you defeat the dragon
        
        //else// you are defeated
        
//Run//        
        
        //if you run// dragon burns the shit out of you

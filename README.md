You wake up near a range of mountains that stretch across the horizon. Before you appears a glass key and three different chests. You realize that the key can open only one of these chests before falling apart. You have to choose:

A. A chest that is emitting a mystic light glow. You feel that something magic is inside.
B. The second chest looks sturdy, reinforced with metal casings. It looks like a soldier's footlocker.
C. The third chest looks from a technologically advanced era, all the machinery reinforcing it looks like from a sci-fi movie.

After opening the chest you find a glorious Wizard's Staff inside. You check out the newly found weapon adn find out that it can shoot powerful magic fireballs. The broken glass key leaves you wondering what interesting items the other two chests might have contained.

You open the sturdy chest and the key breaks, leaving you with an open chest that contains a Sharp Bastard Sword. You swing it slashing the air and the Sword feels perfectly balanced. You wonder what the other two chests could have provided.

You insert the glass key and hear some sort of buzz, the chest slowly opens before you and in a cloud of some sort of steam at the bottom of the chest you find a Plasma Blaster. The weapon seems pretty cool, but you wonder about the other two chests. However the broken glass key seems beyond repair.

you decide that sitting near a mountain will not get you anywhere. Besides, you want to check out your newfound weapon, so you look around trying to decide which way  to go. Mountains behind you leave you with three choices:

A. a mysterious forest to the north.

B. a winding path to the east.

C. a meadow with a strange portal to the south.

You move towards the forest, it looks as if the trees move aside to make way for you to enter. As you step into the forest you har wind blowing through the leaves. The opening closes behind you.

Following the path to the east you approach a small hut. Thin line of smoke is coming from the chimney, it seems that there is someone living there.

As you approach the portal, you feel being pulled towards it.
